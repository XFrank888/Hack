# iConnect_Hackthon

iConnect is an application that can help students manage their workload and finish their education effectively. The iConnect is the pipeline between Blackboard and Brightspace. Students can view all assignment deadlines by clicking the iConnect symbol. The created extension retrieves all your upcoming assignments from Blackboard and BrightSpace and arranges them automatically according to your preferences. Additionally, there is a chat box for students to socialize and talk with their classmates. Also, we have a game option for SBU students to have fun after their studies. iConnect wishes to provide the user with more excellent facilitation. Students can use iConnect to navigate various websites, including Handshake, Degree Works, Campus Printer, etc. On our chrome extension page is our motivating quotation, which is our hope to support SBU students to have a positive and productive day. We care about SBU students, their studies, mental health, and social life.
